Real Steel - frontend (mock)
How to run:
- Open index.html in your browser.
- Product cards use Bootstrap CSS (loaded from CDN).
- Data is mocked in js/main.js and stored in localStorage for cart/users.
- Backend is not connected (per request). Endpoints to implement later:
  GET /api/products
  POST /api/register
  POST /api/order
